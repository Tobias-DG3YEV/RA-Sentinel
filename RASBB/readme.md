### RASBB -the RA-Sentinel Baseband Board

The RASBB is the interface between the world of analogue and discrete radio waves.
After the RFFE2400 has electrically been received, downconverted to a zero intermediate frequency band and lateron converted into a stream of discrete numbers,
The RASBB comes into play by lifting up the reveived goods from OSI layer 1 (Physical) to OSI layer 2 (Data link).
