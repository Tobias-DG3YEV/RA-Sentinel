## Errors, Issues and improvements found in RASBB PCB design revision A.

| ID 	| State 	| Description 	                      | Solution          |
|----	|-------	|-------------	                      |-------            |
| 1  	| open  	| Footprint J5 and J6 are 1.0mm pitch | change to 1.27mm  |
| 2  	| closed  | Rename Pins of D11 to JTAG signal   | |
| 3  	| closed  | Add marking point of Pin 1 on headers  | |
| 4  	| closed  | J9 is smaller than expected         | needs to be shifted more towards PCB edge |
| 5  	| closed 	| J12 needs a 180deg rotation         | |
| 6  	| closed 	| DDR3 RAM VSSQ_5 connected to 1.35V  | |
| 7  	| closed  | Add LEDs to all DC DC Outputs       | |
| 8  	| closed  	| Add shut restistors at the in/output of 1V DC DC | |
| 9  	| closed 	| 1V DC DC EN voltage too low         | Modify the value of resistor divider R36 and R37|
| 10 	| closed  | No Indication fur MCU if FPGA is on | Wire the two DONE lines from FPGAs to unused MCU pins |
| 11 	| closed  | No visible feedback from FPGAs | Add some indication LEDS to each FPGA |
| 12	| open    | Rename DEBUG pins of FPGA           | Better call them ICON01 02 etc |
| 13	| open    | ICON change from J5/J6 to one 50pin 0.5mm FPC | also pin count needs to be increased to 32+8, a total of 40 lines |
| 14 	| open    | ICON has no protection resistor     | add 47R resistor arrays on each side towards FPGA |
| 15	| closed  | MCU LEDs are very bright  	        | increase pre-diode resistors to 1k |
| 16	| closed  | J16, J18 Non-Standard header spacing | increase spacing of J16, J18 to 0.1" / 2.54mm |
| 17 	| closed  | Add human readable labels to pin headers | like "MCU JTAG", "AP JTAG" (for FPGA01) and "DP JRAG" f√ºr FPGA02 and add thermal isolation to drill holes |
| 18 	| closed  | Rotate one JTAG pin header so the have the same orientation | |
| 19	| open    | Add one more button for FPGA internal Reset | Maybe use smaller ones and change thos of PROGRAM_B also to save space |
| 20	| open    | Change U12 to RTL8211FS with PTP support | |
| 21	| closed  | Add JTAG header target to silkscreen Text | like "STM32", "FPGA 1", "FPGA 2"|
| 22	| closed  | Correct second flash signals to FPGA2 | SO and SI connection should be swapped |
| 23	| closed  | Terminate all LVSD signals with 100Ohm |  |
| 24	| closed  | Pin out of ethernet jacks are wrong. | Pins 17-20 are mixed with 13-16 |
| 25	| open    | DDR3 RAM A14 not connected | wire to free pin on same bank as A13 |
