# RA-Sentinel System Overview

The **RA-Sentinel** system consists of two main boards that work together to enable high-performance RF signal reception, digitization, and processing.

## RA-Sentinel Radio Front-End Board (RASRF)
The **RASRF** board is responsible for receiving and conditioning, and digitizing RF signals before transmitting them to the baseband processor.
 - The antenna is connected through a Balun to an RF front-end transceiver, which performs signal reception, downconversion, and filtering.
 - The downconverted signal is then conditioned using a driver circuit optimized for impedance matching and signal integrity.
 - A high-speed 12-bit ADC samples a 40 MHz portion of the 2.4 GHz radio spectrum, converting it into a 960 Mbit/s data stream (2 channels: I+Q, 12-bit each @ 40 
   MSPS). 
 - The digitized data is transmitted over a PCIe interface to the RASBB board for baseband processing.

## RA-Sentinel Baseband Board (RASBB)
The **RASBB** board processes the received digital RF data and manages higher-layer communication.
 - It performs baseband signal processing, extracting relevant information from the digitized RF data.
 - It transitions the processed data from OSI Layer 1 (Physical) to OSI Layer 2 (Data Link) for further communication and protocol handling.
 - The board integrates additional processing units and interfaces for system-level control, data management, and external communication.

Together, the **RASRF** and **RASBB** boards create a scalable, high-performance platform for RF signal acquisition and real-time processing.

Below is the block diagram illustrating the architecture of both boards and their interconnections:
